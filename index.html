        <title>Ms Johnson's Vacation</title>
          <h4> THE VIRGIN ISLANDS</h4>
    <p> This is the beginning of a NEW CHAPTER in the life and times of Ms Johnson.
        At a young age I started out tinkering with electronics you know, like taking them apart when they stop working to see if I could fix it. This was such a natural thing to me, don't know why I thought I could fix everything, but Hey, this was my belief and I was deternind to see it through. </p>
        <p> Fast-forward I ended up in an electronic Technician class in high school, graduated early with dreams of going to the military to become a MP (Military Police) I was too short so they offered to put me on the front line (INFINITRY) no thanks! passed on that. Went on to become a nurse and then a Professional driver for 25 years all while becoming a Project Manager. I've just not had the results that I've wanted throughout this journey. <br>
            That was until......</p>
        <h2>"The world of coding found me !!.</h2>
        <p> Being a coder will allow me to live abroad and still have  a cemented  career. I doubted myself several times on this journey, didn't know if I'd make it through it.<br> Glad to say, Im doing great and on the way to my dream life. "</p>
